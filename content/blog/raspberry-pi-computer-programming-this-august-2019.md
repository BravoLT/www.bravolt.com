At Bravo LT, we believe STEM education is key to strengthening West Michigan from the inside out. We’re excited to host another session of Raspberry Pi Youth Camp, this summer, which will give local students (ages 12-15) an opportunity to explore computer programming in a fun and engaging way.

The free event will be held on August 12 & 13, 2019 at the Bravo office in Grand Rapids from 5:30pm – 8pm. The event is powered by our developers, who generously volunteer their time to lead camp. This session of camp will focus on the Python programming language. Youth participants will explore exciting, hands-on projects and Raspberry Pi devices — inexpensive credit card-sized computers that plug into TVs or monitors and use keyboards and mice — to learn programming.

Registration filled up quickly for camp but we have a few spots left: [Register Here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/raspberry-pi-youth-computer-programming-camp-tickets-48106234041)
