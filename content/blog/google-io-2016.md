##### Code Art Prize #####
Google I/O Extended GR Gold Sponsor Bravo LT is excited to announce Code-Art Prize, our Code Challenge, just in time for this yearâ€™s big event! Code-Art Prize is a contest with an emphasis on functional code that is, also, beautiful. The problems will be posted on GitHub Tuesday, May 17, and the Challenge closes Wednesday, May 18, at 3pm. Participants who design the most elegant code will be entered into a raffle to win a Google Home.

Be sure to visit the Bravo LT booth at I/O GR for even more fun, prizes, and surprises.

We hope to see you there!
