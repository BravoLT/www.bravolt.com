##### Equip Your Teams with Agile #####
We're passionate about equipping your teams with the cutting-edge Lean Agile Certification training they need!

This summer we hosted an Agile Advanced Scrum Master Certification course in down-town Grand Rapids. We had a blast hosting and teaching participants from Gordon Food Service, Meijer, Spectrum Health, and more. Most beneficially, great discussions formed across the varying industries which created a learning environment filled with collaboration.

During the two day certification course we covered such things as:

* - Scrum Master Role in the Enterprise
* - Applying Agile Principles: a Scrum Master’s Perspective
* - Agile and Scrum Anti-Patterns
* - Facilitating Program Execution
* - Improving Flow with Kanban and XP
* - Building High-Performing Teams
* - Improving Program Performance with Inspect and Adapt
</br>

Our Bronze Partnership in Agile allows us to advise our clients on the Scaled Agile Framework to help them reach their business goals more effectively. We’re excited to continue to offer Lean Agile training locally since we’ve seen first hand how applying Agile project management methodologies creates big wins for our clients in various enterprises.
