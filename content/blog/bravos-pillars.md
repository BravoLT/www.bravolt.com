##### Doing Things Differently #####
We’ve worked hard to earn our reputation as an elite learning and technology solutions provider in the growing West Michigan tech scene. How? We like to do things differently. From the way we invest in our employees, to the strong relationships we foster with clients, we empower the community in all that we do.

Below are the Four Pillars with which we’ve built our foundation. We’ve leveraged our extensive industry knowledge and innovative practices to establish trust with our partners and create synergy within their businesses.

Contact us today to see how we can help you get the job done right the first time.

##### Trust #####
When you work with us, you gain a partner you can trust every step of the way. Our ability to integrate functional expertise and technical capabilities with well-founded talent-management practices creates performance that works. You can also trust in our commitment to doing the job right, and seeing it through to the finish line because we believe your success is our success. Period.

##### Synergy #####
“Synergy” might sound like a corporate buzzword, but it’s a concept we swear by. Recent studies show that pure outsourcing is ineffective, while outsourcing locally actually reduces operating costs. How? The answer lies in expertise. By combining our people and skills with your business, we form a synergistic partnership with you that results in higher-quality work done in less time.

##### Knowledge #####
Our people are the best at what they do—and we’re not just saying that. Bravo LT’s talented IT staff meets rigorous education, experience, and soft-skill requirements. Our team members are also out-of-the-box thinkers, each with a bachelor’s or master’s degree in a technology-related discipline. They boast proven track records and have worked for organizations such as Microsoft, Ford, GM, Meijer, and Herman Miller.

##### Innovation #####
Diverting in-house resources to creating and maintaining applications costs you time and money. We help you solve that challenge through our own innovation, including state-of-the-art processes and solutions to meet your industry-specific needs. Our software processes, based on sound business analysis, agile project management, and test-driven development, enable your success.
