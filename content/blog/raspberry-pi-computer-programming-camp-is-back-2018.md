At Bravo LT, we believe STEM education is key to strengthening West Michigan from the inside out. We’re excited to host another session of Raspberry Pi Youth Camp, this fall, which will give local students (ages 12-15) an opportunity to explore computer programming in a fun and engaging way.

The free event will be held on September 11 & 12, 2018 at Calvin College in Grand Rapids from 5pm – 8pm. The event is powered by our developers, who generously volunteer their time to lead camp. This session of camp will focus in on the Python programming language. Youth participants will explore exciting, hands-on projects and Raspberry Pi devices — inexpensive credit card-sized computers that plug into TVs or monitors and use keyboards and mice — to learn programming.

Registration filled up quickly for camp. Reach out to us if you'd like your son or daughter put on the wait-list.

If you’re a company, family, or individual who believes in inspiring students within STEM fields and bridging the gender and diversity gap in the tech sector — we invite you to support Pi Camp by becoming a Champion of Technology for Children, today! Email info@bravolt.com to learn about how you can support students with your donation to camp.

Be sure to check out all the fun we had at our summer session of camp:
