##### Our New Location#####

Bravo has officially moved downtown Grand Rapids! Last month we said goodbye to our Cascade Parkway location and (after a few construction projects and a bit of cosmetic work in the new space) hello to Monroe Center. Our official signage is in the works, but in the meantime, we are the dark gray building located at the corner of Division and Monroe Center. More specifically:

_Bravo LT, 40 Monroe Center NW, Suite 11, Grand Rapids, MI 49503_

We are thrilled to be downtown, closer to clients and Bravo LT teammates. We love when our team stops by to grab coffee or stays on site to collaborate on projects. It’s also been a bonus to have such great restaurants and coffee shops nearby. If you see anyone with Bravo LT swag out and about at [Littlebird](https://www.thelittlebirdgr.com/), [Brick and Porter](https://www.brickandportergr.com/), [Madcap](https://madcapcoffee.com/), or [The Paper Studio](https://www.thepaperstudiogr.com/) please say hello! We’re pumped our frequent visits support local businesses.

The biggest reason for moving downtown was to be immersed within the community. As a software development company, we're always looking for ways to inspire and give back to the next generation of developers. Just last week we had the opportunity to tour Innovation Central and begin brainstorming ways our developers may be able to offer exploratory [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) workshops to Innovation students.

If you find yourself walking down Monroe Center, please stop in for coffee or La Croix, to grab some Bravo LT swag, or to simply say hello. We're thankful to our West Michigan clients, and beyond, for supporting Bravo LT throughout the years; we look forward to continued growth and serving you and your businesses in the future.
