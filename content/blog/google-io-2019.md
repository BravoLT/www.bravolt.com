Bravo LT is excited host this summer's Google I/O Extended. The one-day event will be held at the Grand Rapids Chamber, Steelcase Conference Center on Tuesday, May 7, 2019.

We'll have local talks in the morning, developer talks from Google streaming in the afternoon, and an after-party event downtown.

You'll love this opportunity to be under one roof with the local developer/designer community. Don't miss your chance to connect, grow, learn, and play! [Register Today!](https://io.bravolt.com)
