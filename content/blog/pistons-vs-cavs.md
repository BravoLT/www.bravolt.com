##### Friday Night Road Trip! #####
A few of us from #TeamBravo headed south on Friday night, to the Breslin Center at MSU, to see the Pistons and Cavs face off! Since they've both lived in Ohio, Ben and Matthew are die-hard Cleveland fans. Ed and Tom cheered for the Pistons which made for a night of light-hearted rivalry between our cheering section of four.  

Not only do all of us enjoy working together as a collaborative and united team -- we have a heck of a lot of fun outside the office. We make a point to plan lively activities for the team on the regular. This summer about 20 of us from #TeamBravo took in a White Caps game with our spouses and friends. This fall and winter we're looking forward to 80's Night, our office Christmas party, and any impromptu fun that pops up between now and then.
