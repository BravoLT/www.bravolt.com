2016 was a big year for Bravo LT—a year of profound growth. That growth was demonstrated not only through several valuable new business partnerships, but also through the personal development of our employees. Whether they were brushing up on their professional and team-building skills or volunteering their time to support local causes, our team members showed a willingness and commitment to grow as individuals.

Over the course of the year, Bravo LT grew by two project managers, two e-learning experts, and four exciting new partnerships with organizations across Michigan. Through these moves, we have laid the foundation for what we feel will be fruitful development well into the future.

On a more personal level, our employees focused on individual growth. Together, our team engaged in reading and discussing Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People—one of the most influential books of our time—in an effort to improve themselves. They also launched and participated in our new community outreach initiative, Care. Through this program, we collected donations for the Kent County Animal Shelter, sponsored the 2016 Spectrum Health Gala, participated in a bowl-painting party to benefit local food pantry God’s Kitchen, and worked tirelessly to host successful events such as our Raspberry Pi Youth Camp and BOSS educational talks.

This past year, we were fortunate to grow our partnerships with some of the most dynamic businesses in Michigan, and to see our hard-working, talented employees give so generously.

As we reflect on 2016, we’d like to wish all of our friends, family, teammates, and clients a happy holiday season and a prosperous new year!

Best Wishes,
Team Bravo
