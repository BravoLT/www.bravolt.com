      <description>Congrats! You just became a Product Owner. Your knowledge of the industry and the product in development caused the powers that be to put you in charge. Crafting this valuable product is similar to producing a hit song. You want to put out something that is loved by the audience and profitable for the company. You have control over the lyrics, the accompanying music, all the way down to the cover art.</description>

      <description>Our New Location Bravo has officially moved downtown Grand Rapids! Last month we said goodbye to our Cascade Parkway location and (after a few construction projects and a bit of cosmetic work in the new space) hello to Monroe Center. Our official signage is in the works, but in the meantime, we are the dark gray building located at the corner of Division and Monroe Center. More specifically:

      <description>#BravoDoesIO About a month and half ago we weren&amp;rsquo;t sure Google I/O Extended was going to happen. We met with Dan, Sam, and Dan of the Grand Rapids Google Developer Group and they willingly passed the I/O Extended torch to Bravo. They&amp;rsquo;ve done an amazing job hosting a spectacular event for local developers over the past 5 years.
With 40 days to plan an event of this magnitude, we knew we were pure crazy.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Nullable Reference Types in C# 8</title>
      <link>//www.bravolt.com/blog/nullable-reference-types/</link>

      <description>The next version of the C# language, C# 8, is scheduled to ship in September 2019 along with .NET Core 3. C# 8 brings some pretty cool features to the language. One of the features I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about is Nullable Reference Types, which enables developers to prevent many of the problems that often come along with null values.
C# 8 and .NET Core 3 are already in public preview, so you can give them a whirl right now.</description>

      <title>What is REST?</title>

      <guid>//www.bravolt.com/blog/what-is-rest/</guid>
      <description>What is REST? Representational State Transfer (REST) is a very popular term in web development today. REST is used to describe many things, kind of like “API”, and because of that I was very confused by the acronym. The goal of this post is to provide a high-level description of REST in hopes that you will navigate away with a better understanding of the architectural style.
What is RESTful? If you have worked on web software, chances are you have been a part of a design discussion where somebody declared, “______ would be more RESTful”.</description>

      <description>Friday Night Road Trip! A few of us from #TeamBravo headed south on Friday night, to the Breslin Center at MSU, to see the Pistons and Cavs face off! Since they&amp;rsquo;ve both lived in Ohio, Ben and Matthew are die-hard Cleveland fans. Ed and Tom cheered for the Pistons which made for a night of light-hearted rivalry between our cheering section of four.
Not only do all of us enjoy working together as a collaborative and united team &amp;ndash; we have a heck of a lot of fun outside the office.</description>

This summer we hosted an Agile Advanced Scrum Master Certification course in down-town Grand Rapids. We had a blast hosting and teaching participants from Gordon Food Service, Meijer, Spectrum Health, and more. Most beneficially, great discussions formed across the varying industries which created a learning environment filled with collaboration.</description>

      <description>#BravoDoesIO This summer&amp;rsquo;s Google I/O Extended was held at the Knickerbocker in Grand Rapids. Bravo LT was excited to participate as a Gold Sponsor and host several talks as well as the Game of Drones Code Challenge.
Google brought a lot to the table through their livestream event. Many were amazed to see the Google Assistant make a phone call to book a restaurant on behalf of the user. Google was also quite focused on #DigitalWellbeing so everyone can enjoy technology that improves life and doesn’t distract from it, which seems like an important initiative.</description>

Really, we’re just in love with what West Michigan has to offer—the unique people and products that populate every corner of the region.

      <description>When I first interviewed for my position at Bravo LT a little more than a year ago, my interviewer—Bravo LT president Ed—asked me what some of my hobbies were. “Well, I really like listening to music…I like drawing…oh, and I volunteer at the local animal shelter,” I responded. Ed briefly commended me on my volunteering efforts—a nicety, I assumed—and the conversation moved right along.
Fast forward to a few days later when I received an email from Ed telling me I was a good fit for the gig—cool!</description>

      <description>2016 was a big year for Bravo LT—a year of profound growth. That growth was demonstrated not only through several valuable new business partnerships, but also through the personal development of our employees. Whether they were brushing up on their professional and team-building skills or volunteering their time to support local causes, our team members showed a willingness and commitment to grow as individuals.
Over the course of the year, Bravo LT grew by two project managers, two e-learning experts, and four exciting new partnerships with organizations across Michigan.</description>

      <title>Responsive e-Learning - One Size Does Not Fit All</title>

      <description>e-Learning modules have traditionally been static—stiff, heavy courses that are not quite optimized for modern-day mobile devices. Designed in a constrained aspect ratio, these modules can technically fit on any size screen, but they are certainly not optimized to fit well—and that’s hardly the best option when you need to train employees on the go, or simply need to train them on a device other than a desktop computer or laptop.</description>

      <description>In the contracting world, it’s pretty common for client work to slow down in the warmer months. Summertime is a welcome reprieve from the brutally cold Michigan winters, so I don’t exactly blame clients for wanting to enjoy a little time outside of the office! In fact, as a self-proclaimed beach bum, I, too, find myself distracted by a hot and sunny day when Lake Michigan is above 70 degrees.</description>

The free event, held August 9 and 11, 2016 at Davenport University in Grand Rapids, was powered by our developers, who generously volunteered their time to teach camp participants about the Python programming language and Raspberry Pi devices—inexpensive credit card-sized computers that plug into TVs or monitors and use keyboards and mice.</description>

We believe that investing in your community is the best way to ensure a bright future for West Michigan.
